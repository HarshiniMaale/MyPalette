# MyPalette

📌 Problem Statement
Online shoppers often face the "expectation vs. reality" dilemma when outfits that look great on websites don’t suit their actual skin tone. The lack of personalized, skin-tone-aware filtering on fashion platforms leads to poor decision-making, dissatisfaction, and high return rates.

💡 Proposed Solution
SkinTone Styler is a browser extension that uses AI-driven image analysis to detect the user's skin tone and filters clothing items that best complement it. By integrating seamlessly with fashion websites, it enhances personalization, simplifies choices, and improves overall shopping satisfaction.

🔄 Workflow
User Input
Upload a selfie, use webcam, or enter tone description.

Skin Tone Detection
AI analyzes the image to determine the user’s undertone (cool, warm, or neutral).

Clothing Analysis
Images of clothing on the website are fetched and scanned using computer vision techniques to detect their dominant undertone.

Real-time Filtering

Matches are highlighted in green

Non-matching clothes are dimmed (grayscale)

Works continuously as user browses new pages.
