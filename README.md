# 🧠 SkinTone Styler — AI-Powered Fashion Match Extension

## **📌 Problem Statement**

Online shoppers often face an *"expectation vs. reality"* problem when outfits that look great online don’t complement their actual skin tone. This lack of personalized, skin-tone-aware filtering on fashion websites leads to poor decisions, dissatisfaction, and increased return rates.

---

## **💡 Proposed Solution**

**SkinTone Styler** is a browser extension that uses AI-powered image analysis to detect a user's skin tone and filter clothing items that best complement it. By integrating directly with fashion websites, the extension delivers personalized recommendations, simplifies the shopping process, and improves customer satisfaction.

## **🔄 Workflow**

1. **User Input**  
   The user uploads a selfie, uses their webcam, or enters a tone description.

2. **Skin Tone Detection**  
   The extension analyzes the image to determine the user's undertone (cool, warm, or neutral).

3. **Clothing Analysis**  
   All product images on the website are fetched and scanned to detect the undertone of each clothing item.

4. **Real-Time Filtering**  
   - Matching products are **highlighted in green**  
   - Non-matching items are **dimmed to greyscale**  
   - Filtering continues as users navigate across pages dynamically.
